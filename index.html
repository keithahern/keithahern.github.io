I created all the software for the single    board computer inside the display.<br>    <h2>Adomatic</h2>    Adomatic was a clever service which analysed (still image) ads and animated    them automatically using AI and image processing.&nbsp; Adomatic could find    calls to action, headlines, terms and conditions, backgrounds and other    interesting elements.&nbsp; It would then animate them to different themes    and export them as video or HTML5 ads.&nbsp; Adomatic was ahead of its time    but also a difficult concept to explain and was shutdown in 2017.<br>    <h2>Oomph</h2>    <a href="http://oomphhq.com">Oomph</a> was and probably still is the best    digital publishing software for creating interactive magazines for    tablets.&nbsp; Oomph was embraced by magazine publishers especially in    Australia and has won many awards.&nbsp; It was very powerful while being    very simple.&nbsp; As co-founder and CEO I went on an extraordinary 9 year    journey with Oomph which was known as Mogeneration in the early days.&nbsp;    Oomph was sold to one of our primary customers in 2017.<br>    <br>    <h1>Media appearances</h1>    Over my career I have occasionally been asked to comment on emerging    technology especially smart phones, apps, start ups and Augmented    Reality.&nbsp; I have been interviewed on or contributed to ABC    (Australia),&nbsp; Forbes, B&amp;T,&nbsp; Sydney Morning Herald and many    more specialised outlets.&nbsp; <br>    <br>  </body></html>
